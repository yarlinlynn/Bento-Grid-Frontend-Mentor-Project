## 📐 Layout Overview
- The page is structured using CSS Grid, with carefully arranged grid areas to form a modular layout.
- Cards are styled to resemble dashboard or portfolio tiles — each section has its own hierarchy and purpose.
- Responsive behavior ensures the layout stacks or reflows on smaller viewports while preserving visual clarity.
